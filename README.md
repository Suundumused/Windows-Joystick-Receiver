This joystick app is based on the Xbox 360 controller, it transforms the accelerometer (gravity sensor) of the mobile into the left analog stick (for the gaming steering wheel), it also includes all the other buttons, the left and right trigger have been transformed into a single one slider (easier to hold the mobile while accelerating or braking). On Windows you will download the Server Receiver from this repository, and the joystick app from Google Play.

Some games have the option "steering axis dead zone" like Euro Truck Simulator 2, I recommend greatly reduce it to control 100% of the steering, high sensitivity is recommended.

3. Changing to the correct Listen IP and Port
   
   Open start menu search and open CMD, type ipconfig . Look for the IPV4 address corresponding to the computer connection with the modem/router,
   (Ethernet if via cable and WI-FI if wireless), copy the IPV4 address.

   With notepad, create a file named run.bat in the folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Gravity Joystick Receiver (default)
   write this command substituting the IP and port if you need it. Save with type: "All" and open it.

   @echo off
   
   start "" "%~dp0GJWirelessReceiver.exe" --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3470
